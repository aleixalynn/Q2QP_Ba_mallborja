            The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), originally known as the United Nations 
            International Children's Emergency Fund, was created by the United Nations General Assembly 
            on 11 December 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children and mothers in countries 
            that had been devastated by World War II.

            All children have a right to survive, thrive and fulfill their potential – to 
            the benefit of a better world. UNICEF was established in the aftermath of World War II to provide
            emergency relief to children affected by the war, no matter what country they were from.
        </div>

        <div class="mi" id="vimi" style="font-family: lora;">
            UNICEF is committed to ensuring special protection for the most disadvantaged children - victims of war, 
            disasters, extreme poverty, all forms of violence and exploitation and those with disabilities. UNICEF responds in 
            emergencies to protect the rights of children.

                &emsp13;UNICEF works with volunteers primarily through the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme. If you have an undergraduate 
                degree, several years of work experience and are interested in volunteer opportunities around the world, you may be eligible to 
                become a UNV.
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp13;The UNV programme recruits and places volunteers in assignments throughout the United Nations system, including at UNICEF. 
                UNICEF does not recruit UNVs directly but through the UNV programme. To be considered, please visit the UNV candidate signup
                page and register your profile.
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp13;Volunteer opportunities are also offered through our National Committees.
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp13;UN Volunteers not only support the delivery of UNICEF’s programmes, but they also contribute to the 2030 Agenda for 
                Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By serving as a UNV, you contribute positive change in 
                the lives of children and their communities.
